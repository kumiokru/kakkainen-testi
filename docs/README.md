# README
>Fuck your confluence, it sucks donkeyballs


Well, it's fast, is composed mainly on github's flavor of markdown and it doesn't suck donkeyballs like most of Atlassian shit. Also, it seems to support out of the box anchors on page so you can skip there.

Well, how the hell I do get to see the documentation more neatly than as a readme.md on github?
